   [1] Mutator Method    :
  > Mutator methods are functions that modify the original data structure
    (like an array or object) .

  > [we can change the orginal array.]
  //..........................................................................
  Common Mutator methods:
   
  [1] push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length.
  [2] pop() :  Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
  [3] Shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
  [4] unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length.
  [5] splice():  Can add, remove, or replace elements at a specific index within an array.
                 It returns an array containing the deleted elements.

                  HINT: ----> [Unlike slice , splice ,modifies the orginal array]
                   syntax: ---> splic(startIndex,deleteIndex,Item1,Item2)

  [6].sort(): Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.
  [7]reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in an array in place and returns the reversed array.
  [8]fill(): Fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value.

  fills all part of ann array with static value

  [9]copyWithin()

>syntax: array.copyWithin(target, start, end)
> target (Required): The zero-based index to which the copied elements are pasted. Negative values are counted from the end of the array.
> start (Optional): The zero-based index from which to start copying elements. If omitted, it defaults to 0. Negative values are counted from the end.
> end (Optional): The zero-based index at which to stop copying elements. This element is not included in the copy. If omitted, it copies to the end of the array. Negative values are counted from the end.
